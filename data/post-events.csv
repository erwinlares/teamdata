I saw that the most interesting presentations were given by people who call themselves ""not data scientists"". But their presentations captured my attention more than the purely technical talks because hearing how other people have used data to solve social problems was inspiring for me. ","I would recommend seeking more diverse submissions for talks and posters so that the Bazaar provides more opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. I know the organizers have already made great efforts to make the Bazaar more interdisciplinary, and I really appreciate that. As someone from a non-STEM major, I think the Bazaar would be event better if it has more presentations from non-STEM scholars using data to inform and complement their work.

Perhaps with an additional day or two (funding dependent).

Attendance was unfortunately low with the storm warning but perhaps more outreach would be good.
